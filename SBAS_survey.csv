On the one hand, it is nice to see a proposal for coexistence between the BGP-based Internet and SCION-based networks. On the other hand, the benefits are unclear. I can still be attacked from the traditional Internet, especially if I announce the same prefixes there. If I don't, then it's just another private network.

SBAS feels like a purely-acadmic exercise invoking building blocks and terminology that exist in the industry today .... but I as a network operator cannot tell if you are using these terms and building blocks in the same way that we use them today; and whether your solution is referring to organizations and customer relationships with the same levels of trust that exist between those today.  Or more?  or less?","Handing governance responsibilities over to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)","5","Does the governance require trust between the parties involved?  If so, the governance may encounter a scaling problem... people would not want to rely on SBAS if they are not involved in governing it and must trust those that are (if it is critical to the reliable operation of their revenue networks); and if everyone wants to participate in the governance to ensure they have a voice at the table, this may have too many voices to get consensus.  As such, it would seem that the way RIRs operate today may be the best fit.","See my previous comments on the introduction video/background.  As an experienced network operator, your marketing-level introduction of the concepts does not make this feel ""real"" enough to understand how this technically operates outside of a lab environment.  More examples are needed about what trust/political relationships  exist between the different types of organizations; who is running what part of the infrastructure in your diagrams, etc.  As much effort should be invested as possible to avoid creating or using non-standard terminology when current terminology accurately describes what is going on (but only if it is exactly the same - don't reuse existing terms for new components or concepts)"

There are already other systems that solve these problems effectively once deployed and offer the same ""island"" benefits proposed herein. That is, to replicate this more easily, all you really need to do is offer VPNs to a provider that does strict RPKI ROV at their AS border. There's no need to create a whole new system. "
